This project is a desktop-based **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tool** built using 
Python libraries such as **Tkinter, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**.  

The tool is designed for **non-programmers** who want to quickly explore and visualize data 
without writing code. It provides a **dark-themed user interface** with easy-to-use controls.  
Users can:
- ðŸ“‚ Load CSV files
- ðŸ“Š View dataset statistics
- ðŸ“ˆ Generate multiple chart types (Histogram, Scatter, Line, Box, Bar)
- ðŸ’¾ Export charts as PNG or JPEG images  

Unlike web-based tools (Streamlit, Dash), this tool works fully **offline** and is lightweight, 
making it ideal for students, researchers, and professionals who need quick insights into their data.
